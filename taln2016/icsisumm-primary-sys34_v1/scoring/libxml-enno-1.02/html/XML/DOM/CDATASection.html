<A HREF="Node.html">XML::DOM::Node</A>.

<P>CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing characters
that would otherwise be regarded as markup. The only delimiter that is
recognized in a CDATA section is the "]]&gt;" string that ends the CDATA
section. CDATA sections can not be nested. The primary purpose is for
including material such as XML fragments, without needing to escape all
the delimiters.

<P>The DOMString attribute of the Text node holds the text that is
contained by the CDATA section. Note that this may contain characters
that need to be escaped outside of CDATA sections and that, depending
on the character encoding ("charset") chosen for serialization, it may
be impossible to write out some characters as part of a CDATA section.

<P>The CDATASection interface inherits the CharacterData interface through
the Text interface. Adjacent CDATASections nodes are not merged by use
of the Element.normalize() method.

<P><B>NOTE:</B> XML::DOM::Parser and XML::DOM::ValParser convert all CDATASections 
to regular text by default.
To preserve CDATASections, set the parser option KeepCDATA to 1.
