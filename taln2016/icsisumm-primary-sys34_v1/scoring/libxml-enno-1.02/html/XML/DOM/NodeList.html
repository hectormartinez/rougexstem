<P><HR><H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1><P>The NodeList interface provides the abstraction of an ordered
collection of nodes, without defining or constraining how this
collection is implemented.

<P>The items in the NodeList are accessible via an integral index,
starting from 0.

<P>Although the DOM spec states that all NodeLists are "live" in that they
allways reflect changes to the DOM tree, the NodeList returned by
getElementsByTagName is not live in this implementation. See <A>CAVEATS</A>
for details.

greater than or equal to the number of nodes in the list,
this returns undef.

<DT><A NAME="getLength_"><STRONG><P>getLength

</STRONG></A><DD>The number of nodes in the list. The range of valid child
node indices is 0 to length-1 inclusive.
