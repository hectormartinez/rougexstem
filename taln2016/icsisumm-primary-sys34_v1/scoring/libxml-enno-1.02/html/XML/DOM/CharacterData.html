</A></H1><P>XML::DOM::CharacterData - Common interface for Text, CDATASections and Comments

<P><HR><H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1><P>XML::DOM::CharacterData extends <A HREF="Node.html">XML::DOM::Node</A>

<P>The CharacterData interface extends Node with a set of attributes and
methods for accessing character data in the DOM. For clarity this set
is defined here rather than on each object that uses these attributes
and methods. No DOM objects correspond directly to CharacterData,
though Text, Comment and CDATASection do inherit the interface from it. 
All offsets in this interface start from 0.

<H2><A NAME="METHODS">METHODS

</A></H2><DL><DT><A NAME="getData_and_setData_data_"><STRONG><P>getData and setData (data)

</STRONG></A><DD>The character data of the node that implements this
interface. The DOM implementation may not put arbitrary
limits on the amount of data that may be stored in a
CharacterData node. However, implementation limits may mean
that the entirety of a node's data may not fit into a single
DOMString. In such cases, the user may call substringData to
retrieve the data in appropriately sized pieces.

<DT><A NAME="getLength_"><STRONG><P>getLength

</STRONG></A><DD>The number of characters that are available through data and
the substringData method below. This may have the value zero,
i.e., CharacterData nodes may be empty.

<DT><A NAME="substringData_offset_count_"><STRONG><P>substringData (offset, count)

</STRONG></A><DD>Extracts a range of data from the node.

<P>Parameters:
 <I>offset</I>  Start offset of substring to extract.
 <I>count</I>   The number of characters to extract.

<P>Return Value: The specified substring. If the sum of offset and count
exceeds the length, then all characters to the end of
the data are returned.

<DT><A NAME="appendData_str_"><STRONG><P>appendData (str)

</STRONG></A><DD>Appends the string to the end of the character data of the
node. Upon success, data provides access to the concatenation
of data and the DOMString specified.

<DT><A NAME="insertData_offset_arg_"><STRONG><P>insertData (offset, arg)

</STRONG></A><DD>Inserts a string at the specified character offset.

<P>Parameters:
 <I>offset</I>  The character offset at which to insert.
 <I>arg</I>     The DOMString to insert.

<DT><A NAME="deleteData_offset_count_"><STRONG><P>deleteData (offset, count)

</STRONG></A><DD>Removes a range of characters from the node. 
Upon success, data and length reflect the change.
If the sum of offset and count exceeds length then all characters 
from offset to the end of the data are deleted.

<P>Parameters: 
 <I>offset</I>  The offset from which to remove characters. 
 <I>count</I>   The number of characters to delete. 

<DT><A NAME="replaceData_offset_count_arg_"><STRONG><P>replaceData (offset, count, arg)

</STRONG></A><DD>Replaces the characters starting at the specified character
offset with the specified string.

<P>Parameters:
 <I>offset</I>  The offset from which to start replacing.
 <I>count</I>   The number of characters to replace. 
 <I>arg</I>     The DOMString with which the range must be replaced.

<P>If the sum of offset and count exceeds length, then all characters to the end of
the data are replaced (i.e., the effect is the same as a remove method call with 
the same range, followed by an append method invocation).
